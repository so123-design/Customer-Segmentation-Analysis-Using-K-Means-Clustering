# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-Using-K-Means-Clustering
This project leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score, a critical task in targeted marketing and customer relationship management. Using a dataset from a mall, this analysis categorizes customers into clusters that highlight different spending behaviors and income levels. The project uses data visualization to identify an optimal number of clusters, known as the "elbow point," and visualizes each cluster with its centroid. This approach allows businesses to better understand customer profiles and tailor strategies to each segment's needs.
